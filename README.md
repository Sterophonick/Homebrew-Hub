# Disclaimer
This repository is dedicated to preserving many homebrew ROMs from the scene that the community has created.
Some of these ROMs may be offensive. I don't want to censor/remove these ROMs as doing so would be like saying that they 
never ever existed at one point. If you don't want to see things like that, please don't look at them. Thank you!

# Homebrew-Hub
An irresponsible number of legal, homebrew ROMs for use on RetroPie, Flashcarts, or Emulators.

## Why?
Because the homebrew and demoscenes are great and I would like what has been created to exist forever. 

## How?
Several Years of being in the homebrew scene, and also many hours of looking on sites with stuff to preserve.
